    <h3>Before you start preparing an exam</h3>

    <h5><b>Why are you giving an exam to students?</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>To evaluate and grade students.</b> Exams provide a controlled environment for independent work and so are often used to verify the state of students’ learning.
        </li>
        <li><b>To motivate students to study.</b> Students do tend to open their books more often when an evaluation is coming up. Exams can be great motivators.

        </li>
        <li><b>To add variety to student learning.</b> Exams are a form of learning activity. They can enable students to see the material from a different perspective. They also provide feedback that students can then use to improve their understanding.

        </li>
        <li><b>To identify faults and correct them.</b> Exams enable both students and instructors to identify which areas of the material taught are not being understood properly. This allows students to seek help, and instructors to address areas that may need more attention, thus enabling student progression and improvement.

        </li>
        <li><b>To facilitate students’ choices.</b> Certain options sometimes demand that students obtain high results in specific courses (for example, one may need high grades in math to enter an engineering program). The pre-requisites often indicate that the particular option will build on the knowledge obtained in the course. High / poor grades will indicate whether a student should pursue an option or not.

        </li>
        <li><b>To obtain feedback.</b> You can use exams to evaluate your own teaching. Students’ performance on the exam will pinpoint areas where you should spend more time or change your current approach.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>What do you want to assess?</h3>

    <h5>This should be related to your learning outcomes for the course.</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Knowledge or how it is used.</b> You can either directly test knowledge or you can gear exam questions to test students’ application of material taught in class.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Process or product.</b> You can test students’ reasoning skills and evaluate the process by focusing the marks and other feedback on the process they follow to arrive at a solution. Alternatively, you can evaluate the end product.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The communication of ideas.</b> You can evaluate students’ communication skills ­their ability to express themselves - whether this is by writing a cogent argument, or creating an elegant mathematical proof.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Convergent thinking or divergent thinking.</b> You can test your students’ ability to draw a single conclusion from different inputs (convergent thinking). Or you may alternatively want them to come up with different possible answers (divergent thinking). Do you expect different answers from students, or do you expect all of them to provide the same answer?

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Absolute or relative standards.</b> Is student success defined by learning a set amount of material or demonstrating certain skills, or is student success measured by assessing the amount of progress the students make over the duration of the course?

        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    
    <h3>How do you decide what to test and how to test it?</h3>

    <h5>The overall exam should be consistent with your learning outcomes for the course. There are a number of ways to review and prioritize the skills and concepts taught in a course. You could:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the topics list provided in your course outline

        </li>
        <li>Skim through your lecture notes to find key concepts and methods

        </li>
        <li>Review chapter headings and subheadings in the assigned readings.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>What are the qualities of a good / fair exam?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A good exam gives all students an equal opportunity to fully demonstrate their learning. With this in mind, you might reflect on the nature and parameters of your exam. For example, could the exam be administered as a take-home exam? Two students might know the material equally well, but one of them might not perform well under the pressure of a timed or in-class testing situation. In such a case, what is it that you really want to assess: how well each student knows the material, or how well each performs under pressure? Likewise, it might be appropriate to allow students to bring memory aids to an exam. Again, what is it that you really want to assess: their ability to memorize a formula or their ability to use and apply a formula?
            Consistency. If you gave the same exam twice to the same students, they should get a similar grade each time.
            Validity. Make sure your questions address what you want to evaluate.</li>
        <li>Realistic expectations. Your exam should contain questions that match the average student’s ability level. It should also be possible to respond to all questions in the time allowed. To check the exam, ask a teaching assistant to take the test – if they can’t completed it in well under the time permitted then the exam needs to be revised.
            Uses multiple question types. Different students are better at different types of questions. In order to allow all students to demonstrate their abilities, exams should include a variety of types of questions (See the tips sheet “Asking Questions: 6 Types”).

        </li>
        <li>Offer multiple ways to obtain full marks. Exams can be highly stressful and artificial ways to demonstrate knowledge. In recognition of this, you may want to provide questions that allow multiple ways to obtain full marks. For example, ask students to list five of the seven benefits of multiple-choice questions.
            Free of bias. Your students will differ in many ways including language proficiency, socio-economic background, physical disabilities, etc. When constructing an exam, you should keep student differences in mind to watch for ways that the exams could create obstacles for some students. For example, the use of colloquial language could create difficulties for students for whom English is a first language, and examples easily understood by North American students may be inaccessible to international students.
            Redeemable. An exam should not be the sole opportunity to obtain marks. There should be other opportunities as well. Assignments and midterms allow students to practice answering your types of questions and adapt to your expectations.</li>
        <li>Demanding. An exam that is too easy does not accurately measure students’ understanding of the material.</li>
        <li>Transparent marking criteria. Students should know what is expected of them. They should be able to identify the characteristics of a satisfactory answer and understand the relative importance of those characteristics. This can be achieved in many ways; you can provide feedback on assignments, describe your expectations in class, or post model solutions on a course website.
        </li>
        <li>Timely. Spread exams out over the semester. Giving two exams one week apart doesn’t give students adequate time to receive and respond to the feedback provided by the first exam. When possible, plan the exams to fit logically within the flow of the course material. It might be helpful to place tests at the end of important learning units rather than simply give a midterm halfway through the semester. 
            Accessible. For students with disabilities, exams must be amenable to adaptive technologies such as screen-readers or screen magnifiers. Exams that have visual content -- such as charts, maps, and illustrations -- may need to be rendered by Waterloo's AccessAbility Services into a format that works for a given student.
